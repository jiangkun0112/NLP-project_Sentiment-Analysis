# NLP-project_Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, I went over the entire process to build an automatic sentiment analysis using advanced machine learning and deep learning models including NB, SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, LSTM. We introduced different components involved in the whole pipeline and have evaluated and compared the model performance.

# to run the notebook, 
 1: unzip the data.rar file 
 2: run the sentiment analysis.ipynb file.
